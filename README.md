# Exploring-the-Factors-Contributing-to-Obesity-using-Data-Analysis-Approach

## Introduction 

Obesity is a growing public health concern worldwide, and its prevalence has been on the rise in recent decades. Obesity is caused by a variety of factors, many of which are still poorly understood, in addition to genetics and lifestyle choices. It is essential to do accurate and data-driven research on the factors that contribute to obesity in order to address this problem and create effective therapies. 
  
In this study, we will analyse all of the factors that lead to obesity using an artificial intelligence (AI) data analysis technique. We aim to find patterns and relationships that can shed light on the underlying causes of obesity by analysing huge datasets that include data on lifestyle and health-related variables. We will also look at how these factors change among various populations. 
  
This study can help design specific approaches that address the particular causes of obesity in various populations, which has significant implications for public health policy and intervention efforts. Finally, by developing more efficient and long-lasting solutions to this important public health issue, we can better comprehend the complicated and complex nature of obesity. 



## Objectives

1.	Identifying the lifestyle and health-related factors that are associated with obesity, using large datasets that contain information on these factors.
2.	Analyse the patterns and interactions between these factors and determine which combinations of factors are most strongly associated with obesity.
3.	Develop predictive models that can accurately identify individuals at high risk of developing obesity based on their lifestyle and health-related factors.
