# Dataset Used For Project

The datasets were taken from the Kaggle website. Two different datasets were taken from the website, and we combined it into one dataset which has similar variables. We took 2 different datasets that has similar variables to ensure that the AI predictive model has sufficient amount of data to be trained and tested. The unused variables were dropped during the data cleaning process. 

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are the primary source of data for the Diabetes Prediction dataset. EHRs are digital versions of patient health records that contain information about their medical history, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. The data in EHRs is collected and stored by healthcare providers, such as hospitals and clinics, as part of their routine clinical practice. To create the Diabetes Prediction dataset, EHRs were collected from multiple healthcare providers and aggregated into a single dataset. The data was then cleaned and pre-processed to ensure consistency and remove any irrelevant or incomplete information. Finally, EHRs are widely used in clinical practice, making the Diabetes Prediction dataset relevant to real-world healthcare settings.
